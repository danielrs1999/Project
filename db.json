In the socially stratified society, the Japanese are forced to live poor, suppressed lives while the Briannians are respected and live lavishly. Although rebel groups of Japanese do rise up, they are usually crushed by Britannia forces.When his mother is assassinated, former prince of Britannia Lelouch renounces his entitlement to the throne and accuses his unconcerned father, the king of Britannia, of leaving his mother defenseless. After being banished to Japan along with his sister Nunnally (who became blind and unable to walk after getting caught up in their mother's violent assassination), Lelouch swears to his best friend Suzaku that he will destroy Britannia some day. Years later, while hiding out in Area 11 and attending the Britannian school Ashford Academy, Lelouch accidentally gets caught up in a terrorist raid on a military secret; that "secret" ends up being a mysterious girl named C.C., and when Lelouch unwittingly discovers her, she grants him the power of Geass, which allows him to control anyone just by looking into their eyes. At the same time, Lelouch also discovers that Suzaku is now working for the Britannia military, the very military that Lelouch is hoping to destroy.",
